The challenge of the hour is to spread awareness among the artists of the far-off areas of Pakistan to audition their art works and to let them know that their work is sellable and is of paramount importance to the art enthusiasts.

Company Overview

Funkadaa aims to bridge the communication gap between the artisans of Pakistan and the art-lovers from all around the world. Our purpose is to showcase the tradition, heritage and history of Pakistani culture through its artistic representation. Not only do we want to highlight the diversity of flavors and complexity in various forms of artistic expression that flows through our country, but also focus on the detail in precision and accuracy of its execution. 

The operational structure of our organization would be typical of any other e-commerce platform. An online service that will be available 24 hours a day – allowing artists to monitor their sales and customers to make steady purchases. All financial transactions will be secured, as well as the delivery services. Instructions, tutorials and other forms of help would also be provided. Our financial goals for this project are to keep 10% transaction-cuts from every purchase made and a 100 rs. Listing charge for every item placed for sale. With this business plan in mind, we plan to start our business with at least 500 artists on board, populating the website with customers beyond that.  Talking about the history of our company, we’ve had some major triumphs in terms of getting recognition from Incubation centers and Business Professionals for our idea and effort. The company was founded in May 2017. Later in June, the company was selected among the top 11 out of 1000 startups based in Lahore for Incubation at Plan9 Launch-Pad 10. 

Unfortunately, due to inexperience in the business world, we were unable to succeed into the final 8 companies, but we did make enough connections throughout the process in such a short amount of time to count this as a win. Similarly, in August 2017, we were again selected in the top 5 out of 13 contestants for incubation as Netsol’s Idea-Pad 2017. However, due to a few technical reasons we were let down in our prime and promised to be contacted after our College graduation. 

Ever since 2017, we’ve had our ups and downs – but quite recently, we’ve been awarded up to 500$ by Google Women Tech-makers for FunKadaa – helping employ more women through the company in Pakistan. So, in terms of success of the company at this stage (before deployment), I’d say we’re doing quite well.
 
VISION STATEMENT
FunKadaa’s mission is to accumulate, appreciate and propagate the diverse artistic gestures of Pakistan to the whole world.
When talking about the different art forms in Pakistan, generally a huge list comes to mind. While we wish to cater all of it someday, here’s a more shortened version of that list that we are currently going to start off with:
• Jewelry and Accessories: This would not only include hand-crafted jewelry like earrings and bangles, but also new companies that have their own labels and use other platforms such as Instagram and Facebook to communicate their product in the current digital age.
• Clothing and Shoes: We are all aware of the “Lawn Fever” that has afflicted Pakistan in the past few years. Not only major companies take advantage of this, but also smaller companies consisting of a few tailors and a designer such as Agha Noor and Zara Ahmad have also flourished during this time. Our website will be open to all such designers that bring color and passion to life through fabric.
• Home and Living: Say goodbye to old time classics like Interwood and Dolce Vita – there’s a new sheriff in town! Nowadays, new furniture companies are also arising such as Kalamkaar, who have introduced artwork in our home through the simplest of things. Such brilliant interior designers are targeted to use our platform to further improve their sales and even get inspired by others.
• Toys and Entertainment: Does anyone remember playing with those old handmade fans and eating in handmade thaalis as a child? I do! The subtle forms of artistic entertainment in Pakistan are slowly losing their grasp in the Pakistani market – but we tend to revive that by introducing an entertainment section in our company’s sales.
• Wedding and Party: Lehngas and Chollis – Dholak and Dolli, you name it! Indian Weddings are all about Art! The happy couple leaves no stone unturned to make their wedding look like a royal banquet and that’s where we come in. Instead of going from door to door asking people about which is the best company that makes those beautiful wedding tiaras, they will simply login to FunKadaa and browse reviews.
• Collectibles and Vintage: Almost everyone has some Pakistani collectibles in store at their homes. For me, it would be the Salt Lamps from Khewra – not only artistically valuable, but also of good use! FunKadaa plans to be a home to all such Art Collectibles and Vintage Items.
• Craft Supplies and Tools: Finally, for our artistic sellers wanting to make more – they don’t need to go to a store to buy the raw materials for building orders from scratch, because we’ll be carrying the store to them. Craft Supplies and Tools are a major plus point for our store – enabling artists to invest the money their earning back into our website and their own business as well.
And this covers all that will be present in our website for sale. At an easy price of 70 Rs. For delivery – any product uploaded by an artist for sale will be available for purchase to customers at any given time! Now let’s dig a little deeper into the business side of things!
MARKET ANALYSIS
The current industry our product is associated with concerns Pakistani Art and E-Commerce. This industry is not very densely populated in terms of competition, but a few big names do lead much of the shared content – which leaves a lot of room for development for young startups such as this. Considering the recent boom of the Fashion Industry in Pakistan, the Art Industry is bound to follow similar trends
 – whether leading with Interior 
Design or Hand-crafted objects 
such as bags and shoes. As 
far as E-Commerce in 
Pakistan is concerned, 
a few big names in 
our competition 
would include 
Alibaba, Daraz.pk, 
OLX, e-Bay, Etsy, 
and Artsy.pk. All 
these companies 
have major funding 
and are rapidly 
improving their 
products as well as 
expanding their business 
to achieve greater success. 
Alibaba, the Chinese commercial 
giant will always remain the lead of 
the competition – having an estimated 
market value of $380 billion. However, its highly likely that with a refined product that fulfills consumer needs following the same criterion, we can achieve the same amount of success within a few years only.  Our target audience is divided into two halves based on the buyers and the sellers. Young professionals in their early 20s-30s adapting to the Art Market in Pakistan and running independent businesses fit the profile for FunKadaa free-lance sellers. An older audience would generally be more sophisticated and if choose to come aboard our foundation, would require major sponsorships and support, all the 
while making our company a success 
indirectly. On the other hand, in 
terms of customers,
 anyone who is willing to 
purchase art in Pakistan
 – of any form: Furniture
, Entertainment,
 Fashion, etc. are
 specifically targeted to
 come and use our 
website for purchases
. Traditionally, online
 forums are seldom
 used for purchasing
artistic objects, especially
those that cost more 
and are more intricate – 
but considering the success of
Artsy abroad, it’s a fairly common 
thing to do nowadays in our fast-paced 
schedules of life. Our current geographical 
limitations include Lahore only, but we are hoping to expand as soon as we find delivery partners in outer city areas as well. However, a SWOT Analysis of our startup depicts that we still need time for improvement.
 
Marketing and 
Expansion Plan


With proper funding in the 
future, our marketing/expansion 
plan could further be improved 
through print media and 
billboards, but for now – 
these below mentioned strategies work best!
• Media Advertising
o Social Media Platforms have been used to create Advertising posts in the past. Our effort goes into making them as creative as possible. Some of the successful strategies are:
 Artist of The Day Celebrations: Every day we celebrate one local artist by sharing all of his/her artwork with our audience. This encourages the artist himself to propagate the company’s name as well to his peers.
 Tribute to Pakistan’s Historical Artists: A more professional series of videos celebrating Impressionistic Artists as well as Performance Artists of Pakistani – that reached out to a more general public, enhancing our popularity manifold.
 Chit Chat and DIYs: People love seeing how to create new objects from scratch as well as playing fun games with the audience – so we uploaded a few of those videos for pure entertainment.
 ART Humor: Quite popular in the West, jokes and memes are always a good way to share your ideas through relatability.
• Mail
o Emails and Hand-written invitations were sent to artists to welcome them on board our platform. So far, 80 artists from Lahore and 50 from outside have signed up to launch with us once our website deploys.
• Telephone
o For our customers, we will provide a 24-hour service where they can register complaints as well ask any questions that confuse them. For instance, how do I view my previous sales on the website.
• Events
o For making a more solid presence in front of our younger audience, FunKadaa is scheduled to hold three different events this year – Art Competitions at Kinnaird College for Women, Punjab University for Arts and Design and Lahore College University. These events get people hyped about winning prizes, as well as learn a bit about our company in general.
• Joint Advertising
o Craft Stories Lahore has partnered with us to co-advertise our products online and we look forward to such other forms of joint advertising in the future as well.

Operating Plan
The Management of our company would be in the control of the Founders: Ramsha and Ahmad Bilal, ensuring everything goes to plan every day. Our expected date of launch in August 2019, with an initial budget of 5000$ to be spent on the product itself, as well as on marketing and employees. The technology required for operation would be at least one data-storage center and several heavy-engine computers. In order to ensure secure payments, we will require to purchase a few security plugins for the website as well. Our delivery partner for this would be Ali Express – a fairly new delivery service charging 70 Rs. per item. Now, let’s look at some key interfaces (sample project) inside the application: 
NEWSFEED
Users can view a feed of items uploaded by various users in chronological order. They can like, save or checkout items from here as they please.  ITEM-PAGE
Users can expand an item to read its reviews, description and average rating as well as shipment details before they check-out! USER-STATISTICS
Users can also view item and user statistics – their placed orders as well as purchase orders – and schedule their time accordingly.
     

 
Terms and Conditions
This section deals with our damage-control plan: how is FunKadaa going to handle loss – in terms of sales or customers or both. Starting with basic transaction failure scenarios:
• In case the item bought doesn’t fully match the description of the item placed on sale, the customers do hold the right to complain about such sellers and in case of serious frauds / thefts, such sellers will be blocked from the website. However, we will not bear the costs of refunds or returns in any case as we are strictly the middle-man in this situation
• In case the item was broken during delivery – the costs will be covered by the delivery service themselves – attempting to refund the customer or the seller according to the situation at the time.
• In case of low sales, advertising techniques may be utilized – sponsored posts go up on the newsfeed at the top – costing Rs. 200 only. This methodology is also in use by Etsy, with which they allow users to freely advertise branded content to be viewed by users at their earliest!
• In case of loss of customers, we can compensate on the prices for uploading items for sale: only 5% transaction fee, free delivery or discount coupons – this strategy not only acts out as a marketing campaign but also helps increase the number of sales.
• Finally, in case of total loss of sales over a long period of time – our final solution would be to convert the website into an Artistic Social Media Platform – where users can simply view, appreciate and comment on other people’s artwork – such as Google Arts and Culture, but they are unable to make online transactions.
• Damage control is also possible in terms of employees – since this is a startup, cutting back on people’s salaries and trying to accomplish more work through less number of people involved is a tricky option to use – but fairly common in new e-commerce solutions.
• In case of fraudulent buyers, our damage control policy will dictate that every artist is himself responsible for proper branding of items before shipping them off for sale. In case of reselling or black-market profits, our company will not be responsible as we played no role in the production of this artwork in the first place.
• While third party buyers are not preferred on our website, still no clause in our terms and conditions dictates that no one can purchase from our website and sell it at another website to gain profit – however, on our own application, before uploading an item, verification checks will be performed by our staff to make sure that none of the items being placed for sale seem illegal.
 
Funding Sources
A total of five funding sources have been explored so far by FunKadaa:
• Plan 9 Launch Pad: Project of Punjab Information Technology Board’s (PITB) provides a huge platform for startups to identify and maximize tech-related opportunities in Pakistan. The Launchpad is Plan9’s flagship semi-annual and most anticipated event of the year. Since 2012, they have recruited more than 160 startups that are fostering the startup ecosystem. They have been nurturing this startup culture and it is heartening to see that the once young budding entrepreneurs are now successfully making a mark in the world. Plan9 provides selected startups the domain knowledge, workshops, financial support, mentorship and business planning to bring inclusive, for-profit businesses to life. In 2017, FunKadaa stood 13th out of 1000 contestants participating in Launch Pad 10. This year, we have participated in Launch Pad 12 once more.

• NETSOL’s NSPIRE: NSPIRE is the first Business and Tech Incubator launched by an established IT company in Pakistan, NETSOL Technologies – a leading IT company with the global footprint. Leveraging the large pool of industry leaders and the best practices, NSPIRE enables budding entrepreneurs to launch their startups successfully. They offer state of the art infrastructure; training and mentorship; networking opportunities; cutting edge technologies; investment opportunities and other professional assistance. In 2017, FunKadaa stood 5th out of 13 contestants (final unreleased reports) participating in Idea Pad 2017. This year, once again we have participated in NETSOL NSPIRE to get more knowledge and expertise – from Mr. Salim Ghauri himself.







• Google WTM APAC: Google Google's Women Tech-makers program provides visibility, community, and resources for women in technology. From 2014 to present, Women Tech-makers is continually launching global scalable initiatives and piloting new programs to support and empower women in the industry. This includes events such as Google I/O and IWD, as well providing funds to local communities and WTM members to carry out initiatives and to support their privately-owned technical businesses. In October 2018, in addition to a 1000$ scholarship and a trip to Singapore, Google WTM invested 400$ into FunKadaa, with a promise of female inclusion in the company after its launch. We plan to apply for re-imbursements this year as well.

• Creative Incubator – Pi School: Through this incubator, they aim to “define a creative standard, a process that enables upcoming generations to use creativity and design to apply solutions to real-world problems that go beyond communication campaigns. Transforming ideas into high impact and purposeful actions.” Pi School gives out a maximum of 90 scholarship. In partnership with the Art Directors Club of Europe and partially funded by the Creative Europe Program of the European Union, Pi School is making sure that the top 90 applicants receive an 80% coverage of the program costs through the scholarships. We have placed an application this year for incubation in 2019.
• Allied Bank: Whether you are a trader, service provider or manufacturer with funding requirement of up to Rs. 15 million, ABL’s Allied Business Finance is an ideal fit to cater to your financial / working capital needs. They offer speedy loan approval at a competitive pricing, quick and easy processing, affordable mark-up, running Finance (Revolving Credit), Letter of Credit, Letter of Guarantee and other export / import related working capital facilities and a finance amount up to PKR 15 million secured by acceptable Residential / Commercial / Industrial real estate. We applied to the Prime Minister Youth Business Loan scheme, and were rejected on the following criteria:


















Some other funding sources that were explored include: Meezan Bank (Faisal Town Branch – asset loans available only), LUMS NIC Incubator (Registrations start in November 2019) and Start-up Turkey (Registrations begin in July 2019).
